# Design Time

Telerik UI for WinForms supports the Visual Studio .NET Core WinForms designer. All of the Telerik designers are migrated and the controls are populated in the toolbox. We have special control designers, action lists, property builders and editors matching the design time experience you see on the full .NET framework. 

## Requirements

The design time assemblies in .NET Core are resolved via the installed in the project NuGet packages. In order use the new designers, please make sure that the following requirements are met:

*  **Visual Studio 2019 Preview, version 16.8 Preview 3 or newer**: [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/)
    - Donâ€™t forget to enable the designer in *Tools > Options > Environment > Preview Features*.
* **Telerik UI for WinForms NuGet installed in the project**: [https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/winforms/visual-studio-integration/install-using-nuget](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/winforms/visual-studio-integration/install-using-nuget)
     - Telerik UI for Winforms R3 2020 or newer and it should contain a UI control
* **Target .NET 5.0 in your project**
