# CosmosDB

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service which enables you to develop document, key-value, wide-column, and graph databases by using popular APIs and programming models. This article will show you how to integrate the RadGridView control to work with your remote database.

For the purposes of this article, we will assume that you've already set up the FamilyDB database and FamilyCollection collection from the [SQL API Getting Started Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-get-started).
