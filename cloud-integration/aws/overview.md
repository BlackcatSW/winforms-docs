# AWS (Amazon Web Services)

Amazon Web Services is a cloud platform that provides a wide range of cloud services.

## Prerequisites

In order to build and run the examples from the articles you will need an active AWS account. Your system should have .NET Framework 3.5 or later and Visual Studio 2010 or later. In addition, we use the [AWS SDK for .NET](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/), which provides everything you need in order to build your application using Visual Studio. You will need to set up a security profile for DynamoDB in Visual Studio. 

The [Getting Started]({%slug cloud-services/aws/getting-started%}) article shows how you can setup your environment.
