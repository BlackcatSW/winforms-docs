# First Steps
This article explains how to get the Telerik UI for WinForms controls in your project and start using them quickly.
The process consists of the following steps:

1. [Download the Controls](#download-the-controls)
1. [Add the Controls to Your Project](#add-the-controls-to-your-project)
1. [Add Telerik Control to a Form](#add-telerik-control-to-a-form)

Once you have your first simple control up and running, take a look at the [next steps](#next-steps) section to start exploring the control functionality in more detail.

## Download the Controls
The easiest way to get the controls to your development machine is to use the [Progress Control Panel](https://www.telerik.com/download-trial-file/v2/control-panel) or to download the automated MSI installer from [your telerik.com account](https://www.telerik.com/account/product-download?product=RCWF).

## Add the Controls to Your Project

The easiest way to get the Telerik UI for WinForms controls in your project is to:

1. Install the [Telerik WinForms Visual Studio Extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TelerikInc.TelerikWinFormsVSExtensions) or open Visual Studio and go to **Tools** > **Extensions and Updates** >  **search** the **Online** Visual Studio Marketplace for "**telerik winforms vsextensions**". If you are running Visual Studion 2019 you will need to go to **Extentions** > **Manage Extensions**.

    Make sure that you restart VS to allow it to install the extensions.

1. Reference the controls in your project:

    * If you **do not have a project**, run the [Create Project Wizard]({% slug winforms/installation-deployment-and-distribution/visual-studio-extensions/project-creation %}).

        ![Run Create Project Wizard](images/installation-deployment-and-distribution-vsx-overview001.png "Run Create Project Wizard")

	* If you already **have a WebForms project**, run the [Convert Project Wizard]({% slug winforms/installation-deployment-and-distribution/visual-studio-extensions/project-convert %}).

## Add Telerik Control to a Form

The final step is to add a Telerik control to your application.

1. **Add a Telerik control** to a form. As an example we will use a [RadDropDownButton]({% slug winforms/buttons/dropdownbutton/getting-started %}) control.

To programmaticallyÂ add a __RadDropDownButton__ to a form, create a new instance of a __RadDropDownButton__, and add it to the form __Controls__ collection.

#### Adding a RadDropDownButton at runtime 

````C#
RadDropDownButton radDropDownButton = new RadDropDownButton();
radDropDownButton1.Text = "Fruits";
RadMenuItem item1 = new RadMenuItem("Orange");
radDropDownButton1.Items.Add(item1);
RadMenuItem item2 = new RadMenuItem("Lemon");
radDropDownButton1.Items.Add(item2);
RadMenuItem item3 = new RadMenuItem("Banana");
radDropDownButton1.Items.Add(item3);
this.Controls.Add(radDropDownButton);

````
````VB.NET
Dim radDropDownButton As New RadDropDownButton()
radDropDownButton1.Text = "Fruits"
Dim item1 As New RadMenuItem("Orange")
radDropDownButton1.Items.Add(item1)
Dim item2 As New RadMenuItem("Lemon")
radDropDownButton1.Items.Add(item2)
Dim item3 As New RadMenuItem("Banana")
radDropDownButton1.Items.Add(item3)
Me.Controls.Add(radDropDownButton)

````

> You can also add a __RadDropDownButton__ control from the Toolbox. To do that simply drag it from the toolbox to the surface of the form designer. If you do not see the Toolbox, go to **View** > **Toolbox**
