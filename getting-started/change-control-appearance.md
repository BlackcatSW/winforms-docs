## Custom Shapes

The [Custom Shape Editor]({% slug winforms/tools/shapeeditor %}) provides an easy way for creating all kinds of custom shapes only by adding, removing and dragging the points which represent the shape.

## Change Control Appearance

[Visual Style Builder]({% slug winforms/tools/visual-style-builder %}) is a stand alone application that allows you to create custom or edit predefined themes. Using Visual Style Builder you can alter, at design-time or run time, a predefined set of properties of a control. Because all Telerik controls are composed of primitives, this customization can be applied at a very fine level of detail.
