__RadStepProgressBar__ enables you to setup a visual element that displayes a multi-step process via number of different steps and a progress track bar between each step. Selecting a step will animate a progress movement from the previously selected step to the new one.

## Key Features

Here are a few of the **StepProgressBar**'s main features:

* __Easily customizeable visuals__: The track bar and each step of the control can be customized by changing their default properties (like color and size) or by replacing the default visualization with a custom one. Read more it the [Appearance]({%slug stepprogressbar-appearance-step%}) section of the documentation.

* __Horizontal and vertical orientations__: The control is arranged horizontally by default (left to right). Additionally, the control can be arranged vertically (top to bottom or bottom to top). Read more in the [Layout]({%slug stepprogressbar-layout%}) article.

__Additional content__: Each step can display content on top and bottom of its visual element. The contents are optional and fully customizeable. Read more in the [Step Item Contents]({%slug stepprogressbar-step-contents%}) article.

* __Theming__ : Like any other control from the UI for WinForms suite, RadStepProgressBar comes with different themes.
