# TrackBar

__RadTrackBar__, sometimes called a slider control, can be used for navigating a large amount of information or for visually adjusting a numeric setting. __RadTrackBar__ consists of a horizontal or vertical bar with a sliding handle that can be moved with the mouse and a series of marks. Each mark represents a particular value that the trackbar can return.
