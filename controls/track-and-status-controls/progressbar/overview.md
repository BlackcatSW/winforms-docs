In addition to using the Telerik Presentation Framework for theming, it offers other advantages over the standard Windows Forms ProgressBar control:

* Support for displaying text and images within the body of the progress bar.

* Dashed and cross-hatched indicator styles.

* Support for displaying two values on a single progress bar. The second value is indicated by a change in shade in the unfilled portion of   the progress bar.
