# TextBox

RadTextBox is a themeable alternative to the standard Windows Forms text box control. It allows you to include a text box in your applications that is consistent in look and feel with the other Telerik UI for for WinForms controls you use. In addition, it allows the developer to set a default text to be displayed when there is no actual data in the text box.
