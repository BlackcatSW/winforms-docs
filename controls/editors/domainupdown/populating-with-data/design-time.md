# Design time
 
This article demonstrates how to populate **RadDomainUpDown** with data at design time. The *RadListDataItem Collection Editor* allows you to do that. You can access it through the *Smart tag >> Edit Items* option:

Another possibility to open the editor is via the **Items** collection in the *Properties* Visual Studio section:

Both ways you can add a **RadListDataItem**  which represents a logical data item which can display specific text and image.
