# Date Formats


The table below displays a list of the standard format characters supported by __RadDateTimePicker__. The format characters are case-sensitive; for example, 'f' and 'F' represent different patterns.
 
| __Format Character__ | __Associated Property/ Description__ |
|----|----|
|d|ShortDatePattern|
|D|LongDatePattern|
|f|Full date and time (long date and short time)|
|F|FullDateTimePattern (long date and long time)|
|g|General (short date and short time)|
|G|General (short date and long time)|
|m, M|MonthDayPattern|
|r, R|RFC1123Pattern|
|s|SortableDateTimePattern (based on ISO 8601) using local time|
|t|ShortTimePattern|
|T|LongTimePattern|
|u|UniversalSortableDateTimePattern using the format for universal time display|
|U|Full date and time (long date and long time) using universal time|

The table below shows a list of patterns that can be combined to create custom patterns. The patterns are case-sensitive; for example, "MM" is recognized, but "mm" is not. If the custom pattern contains white-space characters or characters enclosed in single quotation marks, the output string will also contain those characters. Characters not defined as part of a format pattern or as format characters are reproduced literally.
