# Content Controls (Structured Document Tags)

>important Currently, **RadRichTextEditor** only visualize the value of the content controls and there is no UI that allow you to interact with them. The import and export operations will work with Office Open XML (docx) and XAML formats. When exporting to other formats the content controls will be lost.
