# Styles

__RadRichTextEditor__ supports *Styles* similar to the ones in Microsoft Office.
      
Styles can be created and added to a document programmatically or via the __Styles__ dialog. In addition, styles can be instantiated from a **docx** or a **XAML** document on import, to provide for a consistent look of the document and richer editing capabilities.

## StyleDefinition Overview

The class that contains the logic behind the styles feature is __StyleDefinition__.
        
Each __StyleDefinition__ has the following properties:
        
* __Name__ - the name of the style. All styles in a document have a unique name, which is used as an identifier when applying the style.            

* __DisplayName__ - a name that will be shown in the UI.  

* __Type__ - specifies which document elements the style will target, e.g. a **Paragraph**, a **Table**, a **Span**.    

* __BasedOn__ - specifies that the current style inherits the **StyleDefinition** set to this property. This is how hierarchical Styles can be defined.   

>caution The type of the style must match that of the inherited style. It is not possible to have a Character style inherit a Paragraph style for example.
>

* __BasedOnName__ - the same as above, the only difference being in the way the style is set - using its Name.
            
* __LinkedStyle__ - provides a relation between a **Paragraph** and **Character** style.
            
>caution The __Name__ and __Type__ properties are compulsory for each **StyleDefinition**.

## Types of Styles

The style types that are most commonly used are **Character** styles and styles for **Paragraph**. 

The former styles set values for the properties of **Span**, such as **FontSize**, **ForeColor** and **FontWeight**. These values are contained in the __SpanProperties__ of the style.  When such a style is applied to a document, it changes the formatting of the text in the selection or (if there is no selection) the formatting of the word that the **Caret** is positioned in.

**Paragraph Styles** include properties of a **Paragraph**, such as **Background**, **TextAlignment**, **LineSpacing**, **SpacingAfter**, etc.  The values of these properties are kept in the __ParagraphProperties__ of the **StyleDefinition** object. This type of styles can also contain values of **Character** styles in the __SpanProperties__ property. When applied, the values of the **ParagraphProperties** will be applied to the **Paragraphs** and the values of the **SpanProperties** - to all **Spans** in these **Paragraphs**.

You can have a **Paragraph** style linked to a **Character** style using the __LinkedStyle__ property. In this way, you can apply **Paragraph** and **Span** properties at the same time. The difference between this case and the **Paragraph Styles** that also set **SpanProperties** is the way they are applied.  With linked styles, if you have selection which includes text in only one **Paragraph** the **Paragraph Style** is not applied. In that case, the **Character** style is applied only on the selected part of the document.

Table styles include properties of **Table**, such as **Borders** and **Background**. They are contained in the __TableProperties__ of the style. When such a style is applied to a document, it changes the formatting of the tables.        

## Declaring New Styles

New Styles can be declared and added to the **StylesRepository** of the document. In this way they will be discovered by the default UI and could be applied to parts of the document.

### Declaring a Character Style

This is how a **Character** style can be defined and registered:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\RichTextEditor\Features\Styles.cs region=style}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\RichTextEditor\Features\Styles.vb region=style}} 

````C#
            
StyleDefinition charStyle = new StyleDefinition();
charStyle.Type = StyleType.Character;
charStyle.SpanProperties.FontFamily = new Telerik.WinControls.RichTextEditor.UI.FontFamily("Calibri");
charStyle.SpanProperties.FontSize = Unit.PointToDip(20);
charStyle.SpanProperties.ForeColor = Colors.Orange;
charStyle.DisplayName = "charStyle";
charStyle.Name = "charStyle";
            
this.radRichTextEditor1.Document.StyleRepository.Add(charStyle);

````
````VB.NET
Dim charStyle As New StyleDefinition()
charStyle.Type = StyleType.Character
charStyle.SpanProperties.FontFamily = New Telerik.WinControls.RichTextEditor.UI.FontFamily("Calibri")
charStyle.SpanProperties.FontSize = Unit.PointToDip(20)
charStyle.SpanProperties.ForeColor = Colors.Orange
charStyle.DisplayName = "charStyle"
charStyle.Name = "charStyle"
Me.radRichTextEditor1.Document.StyleRepository.Add(charStyle)

````

{{endregion}} 
 
This style will set "*Calibri*" as a **FontFamily** to the part of the document it is applied to, *20 dip* as a **FontSize** and *Orange* as a **ForeColor**.

### Declaring a Paragraph Style

A paragraph style can be defined as follows:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\RichTextEditor\Features\Styles.cs region=paragraph}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\RichTextEditor\Features\Styles.vb region=paragraph}} 

````C#
paragraph.StyleName = RadDocumentDefaultStyles.GetHeadingStyleNameByIndex(1);

````
````VB.NET
paragraph.StyleName = RadDocumentDefaultStyles.GetHeadingStyleNameByIndex(1)

````

{{endregion}} 

When applied to a **Paragraph**, this style will set the Background color of the **Paragraph** to *Red* and the **TextAlignment** to *Center*.

### Declaring a Linked Style

Linked styles should be used when both properties of **Paragraph** and **Span** should be set by the same style. They can be declared like this:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\RichTextEditor\Features\Styles.cs region=linked}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\RichTextEditor\Features\Styles.vb region=linked}} 

````C#
            
StyleDefinition linkedParagraphStyle = new StyleDefinition();
linkedParagraphStyle.Type = StyleType.Paragraph;
linkedParagraphStyle.ParagraphProperties.Background = Colors.Yellow;
linkedParagraphStyle.DisplayName = "linkedParagraphStyle";
linkedParagraphStyle.Name = "linkedParagraphStyle";
            
StyleDefinition linkedCharStyle = new StyleDefinition();
linkedCharStyle.Type = StyleType.Character;
linkedCharStyle.SpanProperties.FontWeight = FontWeights.Bold;
linkedCharStyle.SpanProperties.FontSize = Unit.PointToDip(30);
linkedCharStyle.SpanProperties.ForeColor = Colors.Purple;
linkedCharStyle.DisplayName = "linkedCharStyle";
linkedCharStyle.Name = "linkedCharStyle";
linkedParagraphStyle.LinkedStyle = linkedCharStyle;
            
this.radRichTextEditor1.Document.StyleRepository.Add(linkedParagraphStyle);
this.radRichTextEditor1.Document.StyleRepository.Add(linkedCharStyle);

````
````VB.NET
Dim linkedParagraphStyle As New StyleDefinition()
linkedParagraphStyle.Type = StyleType.Paragraph
linkedParagraphStyle.ParagraphProperties.Background = Colors.Yellow
linkedParagraphStyle.DisplayName = "linkedParagraphStyle"
linkedParagraphStyle.Name = "linkedParagraphStyle"
Dim linkedCharStyle As New StyleDefinition()
linkedCharStyle.Type = StyleType.Character
linkedCharStyle.SpanProperties.FontWeight = FontWeights.Bold
linkedCharStyle.SpanProperties.FontSize = Unit.PointToDip(30)
linkedCharStyle.SpanProperties.ForeColor = Colors.Purple
linkedCharStyle.DisplayName = "linkedCharStyle"
linkedCharStyle.Name = "linkedCharStyle"
linkedParagraphStyle.LinkedStyle = linkedCharStyle
Me.radRichTextEditor1.Document.StyleRepository.Add(linkedParagraphStyle)
Me.radRichTextEditor1.Document.StyleRepository.Add(linkedCharStyle)

````

{{endregion}} 
 
>note Only styles of type __Paragraph__ and __Character__ can be linked.
>

## Applying a Style

Styles are applied using the __ChangeStyleName__ method of __RadRichTextEditor__ or the __ChangeStyleNameCommand__. In both cases, the parameter that has to be passed is the __Name__ of the **StyleDefinition**.
        
Styles of type **Character** get applied to the currently selected part of the document. If there is no selection, the values that will be changed are those of the word that the **Caret** is positioned in.
        
Styles of type **Paragraph** follow the same logic and are applied to all paragraphs in the selection or the current paragraph. 

For example, the following line will apply the "*linkedParagraphStyle*" to the current **Paragraph** and the parts of the text which are selected:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\RichTextEditor\Features\Styles.cs region=ChangeStyleName}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\RichTextEditor\Features\Styles.vb region=ChangeStyleName}} 

````C#
            
this.radRichTextEditor1.RichTextBoxElement.ChangeStyleName("linkedParagraphStyle");

````
````VB.NET
Me.radRichTextEditor1.RichTextBoxElement.ChangeStyleName("linkedParagraphStyle")

````

{{endregion}} 

Styles of type **LinkedStyle** change the values of the paragraph when there is no selection and apply both their **Paragraph** and **Span** properties. When there is selection, **LinkedStyle** changes only the **Span** properties of the selected text.
        
## Default Styles

The default style for span and paragraph properties is __Normal__. It internally inherits the default style of the document located in __RadDocument.Style__.

The document's default style is only for the current instance of the document and if you create a new document, those settings will not be copied. For this  purpose you can use the __DocumentInheritsDefaultStyleSettings__ property of __RadRichTextEditor__ . When set to *true* it will copy each property you set in __RadRichTextEditor.DefaultStyleSettings__ to newly created documents. You can find more information on setting default style settings on the document [here]({%slug winforms/richtexteditor-/frequently-asked-questions%}))

The default style for table properties is __TableNormal__, which does not inherit any other styles. It has an inheritor - __TableGrid__, which contains predefined borders and is the one applied when inserting a table from the UI of __RadRichTextEditor__.
        
All default styles as well as some other predefined styles can be applied using the members exposed by the __RadDocumentDefaultStyles__ class. The set of properties provided by the class are of type *string* and should be applied using the __StyleName__ property of the respective document element.
        
For example the __TableGrid__ style can be applied to a table as follows:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\RichTextEditor\Features\Styles.cs region=table}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\RichTextEditor\Features\Styles.vb region=table}} 

````C#
table.StyleName = RadDocumentDefaultStyles.DefaultTableGridStyleName;

````
````VB.NET
table.StyleName = RadDocumentDefaultStyles.DefaultTableGridStyleName

````

{{endregion}} 

And a paragraph can have __Heading 1__ style applied to it like this:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\RichTextEditor\Features\Styles.cs region=paragraph}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\RichTextEditor\Features\Styles.vb region=paragraph}} 

````C#
paragraph.StyleName = RadDocumentDefaultStyles.GetHeadingStyleNameByIndex(1);

````
````VB.NET
paragraph.StyleName = RadDocumentDefaultStyles.GetHeadingStyleNameByIndex(1)

````

{{endregion}} 

## Style Evaluation

Each style first checks its local value for the property that is being evaluated and then turns to its base style. If no local value is found, it turns to its default style. If no local value is found, the evaluation system turns to the default style of the document.
        
Here is how style properties for different styles are inherited: 

### Span style

**Span** styles can only be based on other span styles. The inheritance is as follows:

* Span properties are inherited from the base span style.

### Paragraph style

**Paragraph** styles can be based on other paragraph styles or on linked styles.

When a paragraph style is based on another paragraph style the inheritance of the properties is as follows:

* Paragraph properties are inherited from the base paragraph style.

* Span properties are inherited from the base paragraph style.

When a paragraph style is based on a linked style the inheritance of the properties is as follows:

* Paragraph properties are inherited from the paragraph style part in its base linked style.

* Span properties are inherited from the span style part in its base linked style

### Linked style

**Linked** styles are composite styles and their components are a paragraph and a span style with link between them. When paragraph properties need to be applied they are taken from the linked paragraph style and accordingly when span properties need to be applied they are taken from the linked span style.
            
**Linked** styles can be based on other linked styles or on paragraph styles.

* When a linked style is based on a paragraph style the inheritance of the properties is as follows:

* Paragraph properties are inherited from the base paragraph style.

* Span properties are inherited from the base paragraph style.

* When a linked style is based on another linked style the inheritance of the properties is as follows:

* Paragraph properties are inherited from the paragraph style part in its base linked style.

* Span properties are inherited from the span style part in its base linked style.
 
### Table style

Table styles can only be based on other table styles. The inheritance is as follows:

* Span properties are inherited from the base table style.

* Paragraph properties are inherited from the base table style.

* Table cell properties are inherited from the base table style.

* Table properties are inherited from the base table style.
