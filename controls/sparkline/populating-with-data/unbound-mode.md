# Unbound Mode

When using the unbound mode you need to create the series and manually add data points. The you need to set the __Series__ property of the RadSparkline. This is demonstrated in the following example. 

#### Create series manually

#### Create SparkBarSeries

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Sparkline\SparklineCode.cs region=Unbound}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Sparkline\SparklineCode.vb region=Unbound}}
 

{{endregion}}

You can see the result in the following image.
