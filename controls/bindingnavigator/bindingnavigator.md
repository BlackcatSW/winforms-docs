# BindingNavigator

__RadBindingNavigator__â€™s main purpose is to provide a basic UI for navigation through a collection of business objects. __RadBindingNavigator__ can be paired with a [BindingSource component](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.bindingsource%28v=vs.110%29.aspx). The UI of  __RadBindingNavigator__ allows you to add and delete objects as well. The Add operation depends on the setup of the underlying data source.
