# UI Virtualization

__RadSpreadsheet__ supports __UI Virtualization__, which enables it to processes only information that is loaded in the viewable area. In this way, UI elements are created only for the parts of the document actually shown on screen. This reduces the memory footprint of the application and speeds up the loading time, thus additionally enhancing the UI performance.
