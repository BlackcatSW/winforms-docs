# Keyboard Support


A typical business application needs to support "heads-down" data entry that avoids the use of the mouse. With RadGridView the user can:

* Navigate the grid using only the arrow keys.

* Edit rows using the __F2__ or __Enter__ keys, depending on the __BeginEditMode__ value.


| Key | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|Up Arrow|Moves the selection up|
|Down Arrow|Moves the selection down|
|Left Arrow|Moves the selection left|
|Right Arrow|Moves the selection right|
|Enter|Opens the cell editor / Commits the changes|
|F2|Opens the cell editor|
|Esc|Deactivates cell editor and discards the changes|
