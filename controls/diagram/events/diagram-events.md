# Diagram Events
 
This topic covers the specific events exposed by the __RadDiagram__. The events are grouped by their general purpose.

## Rotation Events

* __PreviewRotate__- occurs when item/items is/are about to be rotated.
            

* __Rotate__- occurs when item/items is/are rotated.

* __ConnectionClicked__- occurs when connection is clicked.
            

## Command Events

* __CommandExecuted__- occurs when DiagramCommand is executed.
            

## Items Collection Events

* __ItemsChanging__- occurs while the Items collection is changing its items.
            

* __ItemsChanged__- occurs when Items collection is changed.
            

## Connection Manipulation Events

* __ConnectionManipulationStarted__- event that is raised by a __RadDiagram__ to inform that a connection manipulation is starting.
            

* __ConnectionManipulationCompleted__- event that is raised by a __RadDiagram__ to inform that a connection manipulation is ending.
          

When you manipulate a connection you have two different stages of the process - start of the manipulation and end of the manipulation. When you start manipulating a connection - for instance creating a new connection or detaching a connection, the __ConnectionManipulationStarted__ event is fired. When the manipulation is in its ending stage - the __ConnectionManipulationCompleted__ event is fired. And it is important to work with both events in order to cover all parts of a single connection manipulation. And it is also very crucial to note that both events are designed to represent preview events and their purpose is to allow you to cancel a connection manipulation.
        

This means that the __ConnectionManipulationStarted__ event is fired before the manipulation of a connection is truly started - in this case the __EventArgs (e)__ of the event hold the __e.Connection__ that is going to be manipulated (or created), and the __e.Shape__ and the __e.Connector__ that are part of the manipulation. In case you're starting to drag a new connection out of the connector of a shape, then the __ConnectionManipulationStarted__  will be fired before the connection is created. This way you can cancel the process and therefore the __e.Connection__ property will be null, while the __e.Shape__ and __e.Connector__ properties will hold the shape and the connector where the drag is originating from. And if you're detaching a connection, again you'll have to handle the __ConnectionManipulationStarted__ event as you're starting a new manipulation of a connection. When detaching a connection, the __e.Connection__ property will reflect the connection that is being detached and the __e.Shape__ property will reflect the shape from which the connection is detached. However, please note that in this case the __e.Shape IncomingLinks/OutgoingLinks__ collections will still hold a reference of the current connection as the __ConnectionManipulationStarted__ event is a preview event and when it is fired, the connection isn't really detached yet.
        

The same logic applies for the __ConnectionManipulationCompleted__ event - it is fired just before a connection manipulation is over - for example when attaching a connection to a shape. Again you'll have a reference of the __e.Connection__ that is being attached and the __e.Shape__ to which the connection will be attached, but at this point the connection is still not attached and therefore its __SourceShape/TargetShape__ properties are not updated. 

The arguments of both events expose a __ManipulationStatus__ property. It serves as an indicator for the status of the current connection manipulation. This property is an enumeration that provides the following members:

* __Attaching__- represents the status of a connection that is currently being attached to a shape. This is the status indicated by a __ConnectionManipulationStarted__ event when a connection is created by dragging it out of a connector or in a __ConnectionManipulationCompleted__ when a connection is being attached to a new connector.
            

* __Detaching__- represents the status of a connection that is currently being detached from a shape. Please note that this status can only be indicated by a __ConnectionManipulationStarted__ event as the detaching of a connection can only be in the beginning of a manipulation. 

* __Moving__- represents the status of a connection that is currently being moved. Usually this is a status indicated by a __ConnectionManipulationStarted__ while moving a floating connection.
            

* __Moved__- represents the status of a connection that was moved. Usually this is a status indicated by a __ConnectionManipulationCompleted__ event fired after releasing the mouse to create a floating connection.
            

## Layout Events

* __DiagramLayoutComplete__- occurs when the Layout operation has completed.
            

## Grouping

* __GroupsChanged__- occurs when the root level logical group is created or ungrouped.
            

## Pan and Zoom Events

* __PositionChanged__- fires when the position of the diagram is changed.
            

* __ZoomChanged__- fires when a zoom operation has been performed.
            

## Container Generation Events

* __VisualChildrenChanged__- occurs when a visual object (RadDiagramShape or RadDiagramConnection) is added or removed in the ItemsHost of the Diagram.
            

## AdditionalContent Events

* __PreviewAdditionalContentActivated__- this event is raised by a __RadDiagram__ to inform layouts that the additional content is going to be activated. The event handler receives two arguments:            
            

	* The __sender__ argument contains the __RadDiagram__. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadDiagram__ type.
                

	* An __AdditionalContentActivatedEventArgs__ object, that gives you access to a __ContextItems__ collection. This collection of __IDiagramItem__ objects represents the items that have activated the additional content. In most cases it contains a single item - the __RadDiagramItem__ that has activated the __SettingsPane__.
                

>note Please note that you can handle this event in order to disable the __AdditionalContent (SettingsPane)__ from displaying on certain __RadDiagramItems__ .

* __AdditionalContentActivated__- this event is raised by a __RadDiagram__ to inform layouts that the additional content has been activated. The event handler receives two arguments:
            

	* The __sender__ argument contains the __RadDiagram__. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadDiagram__ type.
                

	* An __AdditionalContentActivatedEventArgs__ object, that gives you access to a __ContextItems__ collection. This collection of __IDiagramItem__ objects represents the items that have activated the additional content. In most cases it contains a single item - the __RadDiagramItem__ that has activated the __SettingsPane__.
