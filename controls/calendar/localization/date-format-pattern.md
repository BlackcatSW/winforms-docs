# Date Format Pattern


The table below displays a list of the standard format characters supported by Telerik RadCalendar. The format characters are case-sensitive; for example, 'f' and 'F' represent different patterns.

<table>
<th>Format Character</th><th>Associated Property/ Description</th>
<tr><td>d</td><td>ShortDatePattern</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>LongDatePattern</td></tr>
<tr><td>f</td><td>Full date and time (long date and short time)</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>FullDateTimePattern (long date and long time)</td></tr>
<tr><td>g</td><td>General (short date and short time)</td></tr>
<tr><td>G</td><td>General (short date and long time)</td></tr>
<tr><td>m, M</td><td>MonthDayPattern</td></tr>
<tr><td>r, R</td><td>RFC1123Pattern</td></tr>
<tr><td>s</td><td>SortableDateTimePattern (based on ISO 8601) using local time</td></tr>
<tr><td>t</td><td>ShortTimePattern</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td>LongTimePattern</td></tr>
<tr><td>u</td><td>UniversalSortableDateTimePattern using the format for universal time display</td></tr>
<tr><td>U</td><td>Full date and time (long date and long time) using universal time</td></tr>
</table>

The table below shows a list of patterns that can be combined to create custom patterns. The patterns are case-sensitive; for example, "MM" is recognized, but "mm" is not. If the custom pattern contains white-space characters or characters enclosed in single quotation marks, the output string will also contain those characters. Characters not defined as part of a format pattern or as format characters are reproduced literally.

<table>

<tr><td>dd</td><td>The day of the month. Single-digit days will have a leading zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ddd</td><td>The abbreviated name of the day of the week, as defined in AbbreviatedDayNames.</td></tr>

<tr><td>MM</td><td>The numeric month. Single-digit months will have a leading zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MMM</td><td>The abbreviated name of the month, as defined in AbbreviatedMonthNames.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MMMM</td><td>The full name of the month, as defined in MonthNames.</td></tr>
<tr><td>y</td><td>The year without the century. If the year without the century is less than 10, the year is displayed with no leading zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>yy</td><td>The year without the century. If the year without the century is less than 10, the year is displayed with a leading zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>yyy</td><td>The year in four digits, including the century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>gg</td><td>The period or era. This pattern is ignored if the date to be formatted does not have an associated period or era string.</td></tr>
