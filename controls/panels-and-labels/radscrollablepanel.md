# RadScrollablePanel

**RadScrollablePanel** is a variation of [RadPanel]({%slug winforms/panels-and-labels/panel%}), but customized to support themable scrollbars. The control is composed of two [RadScrollBars]({%slug winforms/track-and-status-controls/scrollbar%}). and a RadPanel that represents a container for other controls and provides the scrolling functionality. The control can be used exactly as a standard panel - any controls can be easily added to it with the standard Visual Studio drag-and-drop routine. It supports all Telerik Themes, but the appearance of the panel and the scrollbars can be further customized to fit your application skin theme.
