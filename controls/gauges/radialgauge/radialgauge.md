# RadialGauge

The __RadRadialGauge__ control is designed to display a simple value within a definite range. This range is represented in a circular format similar to car speed gauge. The circular container contains a scale in it which controls the overall layout of ticks, tick labels, needles and ranges and renders an optional scale bar.
