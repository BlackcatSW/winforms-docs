# Adding items

Adding items to **RadListView** at design time is possible through the __Items__  collection of the control. This collection is accessible by using the __Smart Tag__ or the __Items__ collection property in the property grid.

Both of these will open __ListViewDataItem Collection Editor__, from where, by clicking the __Add__ button you can add items to the collection. Additionally, on the right hand side, you will see a property grid, where you can change the properties of each item individually.
