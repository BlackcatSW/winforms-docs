# Logical Structure

This article describes the logical structure of __RadPdfViewer__.

## RadFixedDocument

When __LoadDocument__ finishes loading a document, a new __RadFixedDocument__ instance is created. __RadFixedDocument__ represents logically a single PDF document. The members that __RadFixedDocument__ exposes are:

* __Pages__: A collection of __RadFixedPage__ items created for the current document in the viewer.

* __Selection__: Information about the current selection in the document.

* __Annotations__: A collection of all annotations (such as links) in the current document.

* __Destinations__: A collection of all destinations (roughly said “bookmarks”) in the document that have links to them.

* __CaretPosition__: The current position of the caret.

## RadFixedPage

__RadFixedPage__ represents logically a single page of a document. The __Pages__ collection of RadFixedDocument consists of such objects and they are used as data items by the virtualized __RadFixedPageElement__.
