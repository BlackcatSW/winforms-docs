# Removing ToolWindow and DocumentWindow at Runtime
 
__RadDock__ has two different methods which you can call if you want to remove a **ToolWindow**/**DocumentWindow**. The result from these methods depends on the __CloseAction__ property which can have one of these values

* __Close:__ When a **DockWindow** has its __CloseAction__ set to *Close*, this window is closed and detached (but not disposed) from its __RadDock__. You cannot manage it from __RadDock__ collections anymore.
          
* __Hide:__ When a **DockWindow** has its __CloseAction__ set to *Hide*, this window is only closed (hidden) in __RadDock__. However, this window is not detached from its __RadDock__ and you can manage it from the __RadDock__ collections.

* __CloseAndDispose:__ When a __DockWindow__ has its __CloseAction__ set to __CloseAndDispose__, this window is closed and then disposed.
           
##  __RemoveWindow__ 

This method closes and detaches (but does not dispose) a **DockWindow** regardless of its __CloseAction__ property. This will happen if you pass only a **DockWindow** as a parameter. In addition, you can pass a __CloseAction__ parameter. In this case, the **RemoveWindow** method will act differently in accordance with this parameter. 

## CloseWindow

This method has a different result on a **DockWindow** instance, in accordance with the __CloseAction__ property of this instance. 
 
## Default behavior

__DocumentWindow__: If you do not set the __CloseAction__ for a **DocumentWindow** and you close this **DocumentWindow** from the UI, this window is closed with __CloseAction__ set to *CloseAndDispose*, i.e. the **DocumentWindow** is disposed and you cannot reuse it.

__ToolWindow__: If you do not set the __CloseAction__ for a **ToolWindow** and you close the **ToolWindow** from the UI, this window is closed with __CloseAction__ set to *Hide*, i.e. the **ToolWindow** is not disposed and you can reuse it later.
