# Design-time assembly handling



## Significance of the Design Assembly
      

__Telerik.WinControls.UI.Design__ is the design-time assembly responsible for the proper rendering of Telerik UI for WinForms in the Designer.
        

When viewing controls from the designer, Visual Studio tries to resolve the corresponding  __Telerik.WinControls.UI.Design__. If the assembly is not in the __GAC__, controls dependent on it will not be visible when added from the __toolbox__.

## Actions taken during the Telerik UI for WinForms Setup
      

To ensure __proper design time support__ the design assembly is added to the __Global Assembly Cache__ during installation from where Visual Studio can later resolve it.
        

## Actions taken by the Telerik Visual Studio Extensions Wizards
      

When the Telerik Project Wizard offers you available distributions to choose it also checks whether the design assembly is in the GAC and in case it is not, the wizard adds the corresponding __Telerik.WinControls.UI.Design__ from the selected distribution to the GAC.

>tip __Elevated privileges__ are required to add an assembly to the GAC. In case your machine has __User Account Control__ enabled a permission dialog will appear later in the wizard and must be confirmed.

##  Location of Telerik.WinControls.UI.Design assembly
      

The design assembly comes along with the distribution of control assemblies. If the distribution was downloaded through the extensions it can be found in __%APPDATA%\Telerik\Updates__.
