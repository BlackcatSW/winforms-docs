The wizard’s first page lets you:

* Select a Telerik UI version from the list of versions detected on your system

* Download the latest versions available on our website using the __GET LATEST__ button

* Specify which assemblies your project would use. When selecting a Telerik UI for WinForms assembly all dependent controls are selected automatically and vice-versa.

>tip GET LATEST button is available only when there is a newer version released on our web site.
>
> If you prefer the Telerik assemblies to be copied into your solution folder, the __Copy referenced assemblies to solution and source control__ option could be selected only into the [Visual Studio Extensions Options]({%slug winforms/installation-deployment-and-distribution/visual-studio-extensions/options%}).

Through the Convert Project Wizard’s second page you can:
