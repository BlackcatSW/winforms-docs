# Unit Testing with JustMock  

Unit Testing is a known practice in software development for validating that a unit of code (e.g. method) will behave as intended and the tested code will produce the same result every time the test is executed. This is one of the essential methods for improving application's quality.

Sometimes this is easy to be said than done due to different dependencies in the method (unit of code) and how they are controlled. Such dependencies include arguments, using the results of calling other methods, creation of new class instances and working with them, etc. Anything that is not the actual logic of the method under test should be strictly controlled. This allows the method under test to be tested in complete isolation from its dependencies. Mocking is a process employed in unit testing to simulate external dependencies.

Creating mock objects and managing them manually is usually time-consuming. To boost your productivity and focus on the important things, a good option is to use a mocking framework. Telerik [JustMock](https://www.telerik.com/products/mocking.aspx) is the fastest, most flexible and complete mocking solution for crafting unit tests. It allows you to isolate easily a unit of code and verify the testing scenario that you need.
