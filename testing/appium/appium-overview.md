# UI Test Automation with Appium  

You are probably aware that the Coded UI Test for automated UI-driven functional tests has been deprecated - in the release notes for Visual Studio 2019, Microsoft confirmed that Visual Studio 2019 will be the [final version with Coded UI test features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes-v16.0).

Currently, Microsoft recommends using **Appium** with [WinAppDriver](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver) as a UI test tool for desktop and UWP applications. **WinAppDriver** is a service that supports Selenium-like UI Test Automation on Windows Applications.

This section in the documentation will walk you through the process of using **Appium** for **Telerik UI for WinForms** controls.
